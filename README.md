👋 Hi, I’m Eljay (@Eljay-Adobe).

👀 I’m interested in software engineering.

🌱 I’m currently learning **thin** programming language.  I'll probably next take a serious deep look into **Carbon** (the "better C++" attempt).  My favorite programming languages are Python, D, Lua, F#.  I miss programming in assembly language (68000).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular.

📫 How to reach me:  I'm pretty much incommunicado.
